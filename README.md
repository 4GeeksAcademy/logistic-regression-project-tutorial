## 🌱  How to start this project

You will not be forking this time, please take some time to read this instructions:

1. Create a new repository based on [machine learning project](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template/generate) by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template).
2. Open the recently created repostiroy on Gitpod by using the [Gitpod button extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/).
3. Once Gitpod VSCode has finished opening you start your project following the Instructions below.

## 🚛 How to deliver this project

Once you are finished creating your logistic regression model, make sure to commit your changes, push to your repository and go to 4Geeks.com to upload the repository link.

## 📝 Instructions

**(dataset title) data**:

Description of the dataset

**Step 1:**

Go to the following online dataset  (dataset link) and download the data.
Save it yor in your project's 'data/raw' folder. Time to work on it!

**Step 2:**

Use the explore.ipynb notebook to find patterns and valuable information that will help on your cleaning process. 

Don't forget to write your observations.

Use the app.py to create your cleaning pipeline. Save your clean data in the 'data/processed'  folder.


**Step 3:**

Now that you have a better knowledge of the data, in your exploratory notebook create a first logistic regression model with your clean data.

Choose a metric to measure your results.

**Step 4:**

Hypertune your model to improve your results as many times as you want until you feel happy with them.

Again use the app.py to create your final machine learning pipeline. 

Save your final model in the 'models' folder.


>Make sure to add the entire data folder to your .gitignore file. Specially for big datasets, this is very important. 

In your README file write a brief summary of your cleaning and modeling process and also explain where the data comes from (Add the link), because you won't upload any of the data folders.
